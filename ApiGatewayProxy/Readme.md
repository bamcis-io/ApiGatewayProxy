# BAMCIS Authorizer and Proxy
Contains a solution to build an API Gateway endpoint that executes a custom authorizer that allows all calls and passes the Auth header to the main function. If you don't use a custom authorizer and sign the request with AWS SigV4, API Gateway strips that header out of the main function execution, so you need to the authorizer to copy it and include it in the request context.
